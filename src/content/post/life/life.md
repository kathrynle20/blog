Happiness. Career. Social Life. Family. Health. All of these aspects basically summarize most, if not, all parts of my life (if I'm missing something, please let me know, it must mean I'm missing a core piece in my life). Everyday is a constant walk on a tightrope, trying to balance each aspect in a way that maximizes happiness and minimizes regret. These aspects also lead to some fundamental questions I'm still working on trying to answer:

1. Am I happy? What makes me happy?
2. What are my career goals? What work is interesting to me?
3. How do I balance meeting new people with building stronger connections to people I already know with maintaining people who mean a lot to me?
4. What type of relationship and family do I want to build in the future? How do I balance the family that I have and the family that I will build?
5. How do I prioritize my health? What and how to build habits that keep me healthy?

I'll probably break down what I think about each of these categories of questions some other day.
