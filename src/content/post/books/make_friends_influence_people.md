These are some notes and takeaways from the book "How to Make Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie.

## How to Interact with People

### Don't Criticize
Criticism such as "don't do XYZ" or "you're terrible at XYZ" can make people become defensive and won't make someone do or become something you want. Instead, try to think from the other person's perspective and be more understanding of their sitation. Instead of criticizing or condemning their behavior right off the bat, first understand why they did what they did and be forgiving. "Hurting people doesn't change them."

### Show Genuine Appreciation
People yearn for appreciation and feeling important. Giving positive reinforcement makes people want to continue doing what they do well and makes them want to improve. Showing appreciation makes people feel seen and important, which can spark opportunities for developing relationships.

### Evoke a Want in the other person
If you want someone to do something, don't just think about why YOU want them to do it, think about why THEY would want to do it. For example, if you want to play basketball with friends, don't just think about why you want to play basketball. Saying that you think basketball is fun and you want someone to play with might not convince your friends to play with you. However, by thinking about why they might want to play basketball with you like getting exercise or showing how fun it is will make them more eager to play basketball. Another example is if your kid doesn't want to go to kindergarten, instead of saying "you have no choice, you must go," invoke a want in the kid to want to go to kindergarten based on what they might want. One way to do this could be to start fingerpainting and show the kid how fun it is to fingerpaint. Then, you can tell the kid that fingerpainting is something you learn in kindergarten. This might make the kid more excited to go to kindergarten.

## How to Make Friends

### Be Genuinely Interested in People
People love to talk about themselves. Being interested in other people instead of trying to be interesting may be more effective.

### Smile
This creates a great first impression and can bring a spark of happiness to those around you.

### Remember and Use People's Names
Remembering people's names shows that you cared enough to remember and saying their name makes the interaction more personal and close.
