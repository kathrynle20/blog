Wow...I haven't been addicted to a book this badly for a while. Maybe the last book I was think crazy about was "The Will of the Many" by James Islington (must read!!). I've never done a book review before but I felt the need to do one for Mistborn for myself to remember why I love this book so much. Also shoutout to my friend who recommended this book! I will also not put spoilers into this review.

## Prologue
The prologue starts off very mysteriously and almost confusingly. Usually prologues don't have much to do with the actual book but I love how the book references the prologue once in a while. The main takeaway from the prologue is an introduction to one of the main characters of the book, Kelsier, and some interesting things he is able to pull off. We are also immediately hooked and immersed in Sanderson's amazing world building. In this world, everything is gray, covered in ash or mist. Even the people seem to "feel" gray, especially the skaa, who are worked to the bone and treated as less than objects. Foreshadowing themes of the book, Kelsier comes into a plantation and accomplishes what the skaa had thought was impossible. They are astonished.

## Characters
While this book is written in the third person, the book shifts between many characters' perspectives, allowing us to see into their minds. I love how every character has a story, a unique personality, and even flaws. While some books seem to put the main character on a pedastal, this book does so differently. Kelsier is someone who can easily win over the hearts of the people around him, but even his friends may sometimes question his morals. Vin, the other main character, is talented and compassionate, but her past made it hard for her to trust anyone. Allomancers have special powers in this world but we quickly find out their limitations. While reading this book, I found myself questioning what side I was on constantly. I felt sympathy for the skaa and compassion for some of the nobles, confidence when they acheive the impossible and hopelessness in their high-stakes challenge.

## World
While reading this book, I felt like I was watching a movie. I could see the mist and the ash covering the city. I could see the skaa scattered around the streets, backs curved, covered in ash, walking weakly with a gloom expression. I could see the chandeliers and glass windows of the noble houses. 

## Action
This book never stops. Whenever you thought there couldn't be another plot twist, something comes up out of the blue, but the crazy part is that it all makes sense. Nothing is too sudden or without explanation. The action can be a bit hard to follow at times when things are moving quickly and especially when you don't understand the lingo in the book (i.e. Pushing vs Pulling). It took some time (and some effort trying to remember my physics haha) to understand and envision the action going on, but I think it was the thought process and end result that mattered the most anyways. I am also just a lover of anything that has to do with powers so I think this is an added plus to this book already.

## Story line
The storyline and setup were quite clear and motivated. Most of the book moves towards one goal so it is easy to follow and reason about their motivations and obstacles. From the build up to the execution to the resolution, I loved the plot. I am amazed at how everything came together and how every detail was utilized in an unexpected way. After watching a bunch of dramas that all kind of had the same plot, I had a thrill being surprised and put on the edge of my seat with this book. The ending was also spot-on; it provided a satisfying resolution while also hooking you into reading the next book and leaving some deeper questions unanswered.

Overall, 10/10 would recommend you read this book if you love some action, fantasy, and dystopia!

Note: In the future, I hope to somehow figure out how to hide some text with "invisible ink" so I can share some thoughts with spoilers.
